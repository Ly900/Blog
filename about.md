My name is Ly Nguyen and I reside in Washington, D.C. I am currently a student in [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/)'s web development immersive program. It is a 12-week, full-time program that teaches both front-end and back-end technologies and tools.

My graduation date is January 15th, 2016. I am searching for a job as a front-end web developer in the DMV area.
