To install Jekyll, follow the steps below:

1. Type "gem install jekyll" into the command line.
2. Start a new project by typing "jeckyll new \<name-of-project\>." Go into the project.
3. Type "jekyll serve" in the command line to start up the Jekyll-provided local server.
4. Go to the config.yml file to update it with your blog's information (Tip: Every time you change the config file, save it, exit the server by hitting Control + C, type "jeckyll serve" again, and then refresh the page.)
5. Go to Jekyll's "about.md" page and update it with information about yourself (Note: you do not need to restart the server if you make changes outside of the config file- just refresh the browser after changes).
6. Go to Jekyll's "posts" directory and use its sample welcome file to create your first blog.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
